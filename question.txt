12	What is a primary benefit of using the .length method in a for loop when traversing an array?	It makes the code more efficient and adaptable to changes in the array's length.	It increases the array's length dynamically.	It makes the code more efficient and adaptable to changes in the array's length.	It automatically sorts the array.	It initializes the array with default values.
13	What is a key advantage of using an enhanced for loop in Java?	It is shorter to declare than traditional for loops	It can be used with all data structures	It is shorter to declare than traditional for loops	It allows setting specific indexes to values	It requires a control variable
14	What is a disadvantage of using enhanced for loops (for-each loops) when working with arrays?	They cannot modify data within the array based upon a numbered control variable.	They require number values for control variables.	They are longer to declare compared to traditional for loops.	They cannot modify data within the array based upon a numbered control variable.	They can only be used with primitive data types.
15	Which statement best describes the behavior of the control variable in an enhanced for loop when iterating through an array?	The iterating variable is a copy of the array's index and allows for modification of the array's elements.	The iterating variable directly accesses and modifies the array's elements.	The iterating variable is a copy of the array's index and allows for modification of the array's elements.	The iterating variable is always initialized as the first element of the array.	The iterating variable must be an array itself to iterate through the elements.
16	When an entire array is passed into another method in Java, what is the effect on the original array?	Changes made to the array in the method are reflected in the original array.	The original array is unchanged.	The original array is cloned before being passed, so changes in the method do not affect the original array.	Changes made to the array in the method are reflected in the original array.	The original array becomes immutable.
17	In Java, if a specific index of an array is passed into a method and modified within that method, what happens to the original array?	The original array remains unchanged.	The modification affects the original array.	The original array remains unchanged.	The original array is deleted.	The original array becomes a copy.
18	In Java, what happens to an array declared within a method if it is not returned to another method?	It is automatically destroyed when the method execution completes.	It remains in program memory.	It is automatically destroyed when the method execution completes.	It becomes immutable.	A runtime error occurs.
19	When an array declared within a method in Java is returned to another method, what happens to the array's values?	They continue to exist as they are referenced in the other method.	They are deleted.	They remain in memory but become inaccessible.	They continue to exist as they are referenced in the other method.	They are duplicated in memory.
20	In a 2D array declared as int[][] seats = new int[2][6];, how many rows and columns does the array contain respectively?	2 rows; 6 columns	3 rows; 4 columns	2 rows; 6 columns	12 rows; 1 column	1 row; 12 columns
21	Which of the following is NOT a function of the Arrays class in Java?	Creating arrays	Sorting arrays	Searching for values in an array	Creating arrays	Comparing arrays
22	How does the sort() method arrange the elements of the character array charArray?	Alphabetically in ascending order	Alphabetically in reverse order	Alphabetically in ascending order	Alphabetically in descending order	Randomly
23	What condition must be met before using the binarySearch() method from the Arrays class?	The array must be sorted in ascending order	The array must be of primitive data types	The array must be sorted in ascending order	The array must contain only unique elements	The array must be initialized with a specific size
24	If the value being searched for using binarySearch() is not found in the array, how is the result displayed?	A value of -(insertionIndex + 1)	The method returns null	The method throws an exception	The method returns -1	A value of -(insertionIndex + 1)
25	What is the purpose of the equals() method from the Arrays class?	To verify if two arrays have identical values in corresponding indexes	To check if two arrays have the same length	To compare the memory addresses of two arrays	To verify if two arrays have identical values in corresponding indexes	To concatenate two arrays
26	After using the sort() method on char[] charArray = {'a', 'Y', 'q', 'B', 125}, what will the array look like?	{'B', 'Y', 'a', 'q', '125'}	{'B', 'Y', 'a', 'q', '125'}	{'125', 'a', 'B', 'q', 'Y'}	{'a', 'q', 'B', 'Y', '125'}	None of the above
27	What is the result of System.out.println(Arrays.binarySearch(numbers, 4)) given the array int[] numbers = {-1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 4, 5};?	5	-1	4	5	6
28	Given the arrays int[] arr1 = {10, 20, 30}; and int[] arr2 = {10, 20, 30};, what will System.out.println(Arrays.equals(arr1, arr2)); print?	true	It will cause a compilation error	false	true	30
29	Given the arrays int[] arr1 = {10, 20, 30}; and int[] arr2 = {10, 20, 30};, what will System.out.println(arr1 == arr2)); print?	false	It will cause a compilation error	false	true	30
30	Which of the following best describes how the binarySearch() method from the Arrays class works?	It compares the target value with the middle element of the array and then searches either the left or right half based on the comparison.	It compares the target value with the middle element of the array and then searches either the left or right half based on the comparison.	It sequentially checks each element in the array until it finds the target value.	It splits the array into two halves and recursively searches in the half that may contain the target value.	It sorts the array in descending order and then searches for the target value.
